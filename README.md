## Pulling AI Models for Ollama

Ollama uses AI models that you can download (“pull”) onto your computer. Models vary in size and capabilities.

For computers with about **8 GB of RAM**, here are some good models to try:

- **llama3.2** — A strong general-purpose AI model.
- **phi3** — A smaller version that works well with 8 GB RAM.
- **minstral** — can be a little unhinged 

### How to pull a model:

1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).
2. Run this command, replacing `<model-name>` with the model you want, for example, `llama3.2:latest`:
```
ollama pull <model_name>
```
3. Wait for the download to finish.

## How to use this app:

1. Install Ollama and pull your preferred model(s) using the instructions above.
2. Open this app by double-clicking its icon.
3. Use the app for whatever!
